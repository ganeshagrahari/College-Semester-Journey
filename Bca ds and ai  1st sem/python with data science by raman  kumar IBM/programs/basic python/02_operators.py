#1----->Arthmatic operator :-- +, *, -, /, **, //, %

'''print(5/2)
print(5//2)# this fuction exclued value after decimal this is flor devision
print(2**4)
print(7%2) # modulous is reminder of devision'''

#2----> Comparision(Relational) operators :--- <, >, ==, !=, >= ,<=

'''a = 5
b = 2
print(type(a>b))# this returns boolean data type'''
# print(5==2)
# print(5!=2)

#3--->assignment operator

'''a +=5 # same as a= a+5
print(a)'''
# a = 0
# a+=5
# print(a)
'''a = 5
b= 3
a-=9#a=a-9

print(a)'''

#4---->logical operator: and or not
# '''AND'''
# print(4<5 and 4>3 and 5>6) # when ever all condition is true than and return true if one of them is false than all return is  false

# '''OR'''
# print(4<5 or 4>3 or  5>6) # when one of these condition is true than or operator return true.

# '''NOT'''
# print(not 8>9)


#5------>Membership operators in, not in
'''a = [22,33,55,77]
print(77 in a)
b= "Pyhton"
print("P" in b)''' #Same as in not return opposite value

#6-----> Identity operator: it checks than variable is saved in same memory address  or not.

'''x=(5,7)
y=(5,7)
print(x is y)
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(x is y))

a= 5
b=5
print(a is b)
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(a is b))

p= [8,9]
q=[8,9]
print(p is q)
print(id(p))
print(id(q))
print(id(p is q))'''# if saved memory is diffrent than it returns false

#7-----> Bitwise operator:&-bitwise and |-or 
'''a =7#111 binary form
b=4#100 and only 1 1 return true
print(a&b)
print(a|b)#it works as or operator.'''
print(7%2)
